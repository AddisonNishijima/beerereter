## Description

_Beer beer beer beer_

* I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to create a display for it. - _new keg Component_
* I want to see what kegs I have available. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcohol content. _keg-list component_ _keg model object: name string, brand string, price per pint number?, abv number?_
* I want to see a display of how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has 124 pints in it.. I want to be able to click a button on a display of a keg whenever I sell a pint of that kind of beer and have the display of how many pints are left decrease by 1. _keg model sellPint function_
* I want to be able to see all the kegs that have less than 10 pints left so that I can be ready to change them. _filter on keg-list component_
* I want to be able to edit a keg's properties after entering them. _edit-keg component_
* I want to have kegs color coded to show me at a glance if they are cheap or expensive - say greater or less than $5 per pint. I also want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers. _p sure this is front end?_
